# Tupper #
This program will draw [Tupper's self-referential formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupper%27s_self-referential_formula), the formula created by Jeff Tupper.
The function draws an image based on the constant k, which can be edited by changing the number. The use can also create a new constant k by drawing in the render area.

Compiles on Windows using MinGW. Requires libgmp.
